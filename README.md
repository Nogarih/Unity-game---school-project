For this project we had to choose a new technology or programming language to show we can learn something new and implement the knowledge of our course into it.

I choose to learn unity and create a first person zombie shooter.

In this game i added : 
- First person camera
- Walking with keyboard and/ or any controller
- Shooting with a pistol
- Zombies
- Different AI states for zombies : Chasing(walking), standing, noticing when you come near, attacking when close enough
- Key items (Can pick up)
- Locked doors ( need to unlock with key)
- Basic sounds

If you want to try out the game, open the sandbox scene.
